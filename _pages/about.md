I am a research associate at the [Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), working on the [MAVI](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/mavi)(Mobility Assistant for Visually Impaired) project supervised by [Professor Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Professor M Balakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mbala/). My research interests 
are in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.<br>

Currently, I am working on scene text detection and recognition, and object detection for edge devices.
I complete my Bachelor's in Technology at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha 
University majoring in Computer Science and Engineering in 2022.

Research Interest
------
My research interest lies in <b>Computer Vision</b>. Classical computer vision problem statements such as object detection, and text recognition are a few topics that I have worked on in the past.
However, I am not astringent to a specific set of topics and aim to work on a wide variety of problem statements in the future such as Trajectory Prediction for autonomous vehicles, 
Scaling of Transformer based architectures for edge devices and the intersection of Semi-Supervised Learning with Computer Vision.
